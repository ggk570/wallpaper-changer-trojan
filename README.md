# wallpaper-changer-trojan
A python trojan that changes windows wallpaper after ever 10 seconds

Many windows systems when get hacked, the hacker changes their wallpaper to display a certain message to the user or owner of the system
These scripts are for demonstration purpose only.
These are for education purpose only.

Files:
1. "random quotes.py" - Trojan file, will show random quote & save the payload in %USERPROFILE% directory
2. "payload.py" - Actual payload file which will change the wallpaper
3. "startupvb.vbs" - VB Script to start our payload generated by "random quotes.py" without popping up a window, this vb file will be saved in startup menu directory                      So that after ever restart or shutdown, this script will be automatically run by OS & will eventually run our payload script

**Note: Only "random quotes.py" needed to be run on victim's system, no need to run payload.py & startupvb.vbs, as our quotes script will automatically generate the          payload & vbscript & save these files in their appropriate path. "random quotes.py" already has payload in it's content as hexadecimal form. All these files 
        are given in this repositor for demonstration purpose only**

Working:

When a user run this file using command:
  python "random quotes.py"
This script will print a random quote on the screen and saved the payload file as "%USERPROFILE%\.system" & it will also save a vbscript to run this payload after every restart, vbscript will be saved in the startup directory with the filename as "Windows Explorer.vbs"
